# Post Processing

This module performs final data preparation and quality control for all environmental variables in the EarthCul project, ensuring spatial consistency and data integration readiness across all 8 Spanish National Parks.

## Overview

Post-processing is the critical final step that harmonizes diverse environmental datasets from different sources, resolutions, and coordinate systems into a standardized spatial framework suitable for Cultural Ecosystem Services modeling and analysis. This module ensures all variables are spatially aligned, properly clipped, and quality-controlled for subsequent integration.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Spatial Standardization**: Align all rasters to consistent spatial properties
2. **Area of Interest Clipping**: Restrict analysis to park boundaries
3. **Quality Control**: Identify and handle missing data and anomalous values
4. **Metadata Generation**: Document variable properties and characteristics
5. **Integration Preparation**: Prepare data for multi-variable modeling

### Standardization Framework
- **Reference System**: EPSG:3035 (LAEA Europe)
- **Spatial Resolution**: 100m pixel size
- **Spatial Extent**: Park-specific boundaries (AOI_3035.shp)
- **NoData Value**: -9999 (standardized across all layers)
